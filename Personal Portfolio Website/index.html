    <h1 id="introduction">Hi! I'm Kenneth.</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to my website! I'm currently a sophomore studying computer science at Boston College. I recently finished working with the NYC Department of Sanitation this summer as a full-stack development intern. I'm a huge sports fan (of all New York teams: Knicks, Giants, Rangers, Yankees) and I've taken up photography as a hobby as well. Occasionally, I work for the Boston College Acoustics as a concert photographer. If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out to me!
